Logging should be implemented for production and development environment

There should be a production environment

Spotify return a 429 error when the rate limit has been exceeded. With this error comes a "RetryAfter" header
which specifies when the user can make another request. The code should be refactored to automatically call the
API after the specified time has elapsed.

Testing should be implemented. Automated tests could run and give us information about the health of our application.

If many users would use this application, the api calls could be made in a separate microservice where we implement 
Spotifys "extended quota mode" to allow for more api calls.
